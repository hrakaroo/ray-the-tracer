In graduate school I took a 3D rendering class and wrote a ray
tracing renderer in C++ using the Qt libraries for drawing.  The
class was great and I learned a lot, but sadly didn't comment my
code worth a damn so trying to read through any of my code
is like a foreign language.  I have no idea where my algorithms
came from and no idea how to add new objects to the environment or
really manipulate anything.  Also using C++ didn't help as I 
went a bit overboard with operator overloading which was awesome
at the time, but confusing as hell to read later on.

So, 10+ years later I'm giving it another try only this time I'm
going to try writing it in Go so I can take advantage of the 
parallel processing.  I'm also specifically not taking shortcuts
for the sake of clarity.
