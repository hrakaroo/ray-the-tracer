## Ray tracer in a weekend

This is the third (or possibly fourth) ray tracer I've built, only 
for this one I'm doing it in Go and using 
[Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf)
as my guide.  

I'm going to try to put all of my progress pictures into the images folder.
