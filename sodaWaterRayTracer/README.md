## Soda Water Ray Tracer in Go

This was the start to rebuild my Soda Water Ray Tracer in Go.  I selected go
as it's fast, simple to compile, has great parallel computing support
(with goroutines) and a robust garbage collector.  Plus, it has built in
performance profiling which will come in useful as a ray tracer is nearly
entirely CPU bound.

However, after getting some basic shapes working I decided to halt this project
as my geometry knowledge is a bit rusty and trying to re-derive everything
gets old quickly.  Instead I've decided to restart this project (again) only
use the Ray Tracing in a Weekend book as my reference.  See the weekend
folder for progress on that project.
