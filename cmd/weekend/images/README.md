This next image does not match the book as I'm having a hell of a time 
getting defocus blur working.  Not sure what is wrong, but I'm going to 
try to just generate the final picture and see if that works.  I've noticed 
the book has a tendency to leave some (key ?) parts out.  So maybe I'm not 
actually incorrect?
